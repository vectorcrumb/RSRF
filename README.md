# Really Simple Robot Framework 2016

The Really Simple Robot Framework (RSRF) is a simple but very versatile Java framework made for the FIRST Robotics Competition. With nothing more than a simple configuration file on a USB flash drive, teams can be up and running with their robot in minutes. This framework is currently a work in progress. The 2017 version can be found in this [github repo](https://github.com/vectorcrumb/Pie-API). Detailed instructions can be found in the [specs](https://github.com/vectorcrumb/RSRF/blob/master/config_specs.md).

## **This project is no longer active due to the changes in the FRC libraries. Please head to the [Pie-API](https://github.com/vectorcrumb/Pie-API) repository. Thanks!**
